# Polynomial-regression-model
This Model is for predicting the Expected Salary to be offered to a person. The dataset contain the different posts and the salary level at that post. Now, let the person is at a post from last 2 years, so the salary of the employee is between the salary of current post and the next post. So, if we predict based on simple linear regression model, then the prediction might be too wrong as shown in the first part of the model. Then we will see how accurate the Polynomial model. We will increase the degree starting from 2 to get the accurate model.
